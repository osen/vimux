# vimux
A tmux clone for Windows. Great for *ssh* connections or using terminals with no tab support.

## Usage ##
1) Extract or clone project
2) Run **\<extracted\>\bin\vimux**

You might also want to consider adding the **\<extracted\>\bin** folder to the *PATH* so that you can just run **vimux** in any directory.

## Shortcuts ##

Based on similar to tmux (but I only have 4 so far ;)

- **ctrl-b c** - Opens a new terminal instance
- **ctrl-b n** - Changes to next terminal
- **ctrl-b p** - Changes to previous terminal
- **ctrl-b x** - Closes current terminal (and exits **vimux** if no terminals remain)

For example, press and hold **control** then tap **b**. Release **control** and tap **c** to create a new terminal
